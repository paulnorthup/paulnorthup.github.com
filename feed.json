I figured a standard size caf√©/brat seat would look pretty good, so I went with ~2\" of foam, but it looked horrible. The angle of the rear subframe on the LTD model of a KZ550 is steep to support a two-up \"King and Queen\" seat, not the style I was looking for.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/ugly-seat-xl.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/ugly-seat-xl-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/ugly-seat-xl-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/ugly-seat-xl-md.jpeg 768w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/ugly-seat-xl-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/ugly-seat-xl-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/ugly-seat-xl-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  height=\"1020\" width=\"1360\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Here is the ugly seat, with the tire mocked up for positioning. The ramp is longer than the flat section... yuck.<br>I spent some time thinking about the seat frame, mocking up different seat options with cardboard, etc. After a while, I got so frustrated with making no progress I cut off the hoop, chopped the rest of the rear seat frame off, and welded the hoop back on. this gave me a much more aggressive look, and the proportions really started to come together.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/short-seat-2xl.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/short-seat-2xl-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/short-seat-2xl-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/short-seat-2xl-md.jpeg 768w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/short-seat-2xl-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/short-seat-2xl-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://paulnorthup.com/media/posts/1/responsive/short-seat-2xl-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  height=\"1200\" width=\"1600\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    If life gives you subframe lemons, chop them right out and don't worry about 'em.<br>Along with the subframe work, I grinded off the rest of the frame tabs I wasn't going to use and bent the old rear shock mount supports around the new hoop to keep the original lines of the bike. Happy with the progress so far.\n  </p>",
