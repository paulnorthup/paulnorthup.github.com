    I started by cutting the back of the rear subframe off and welding on a new hoop to give a nice clean rounded "butt" to the bike.

    I realized there was a problem with the new hoop when I mocked up a seat with some carpet foam. I figured a standard size caf√©/brat seat would look pretty good, so I went with ~2" of foam, but it looked horrible. The angle of the rear subframe on the LTD model of a KZ550 is steep to support a two-up "King and Queen" seat, not the style I was looking for.<br>

    Here is the ugly seat, with the tire mocked up for positioning. The ramp is longer than the flat section... yuck.<br>I spent some time thinking about the seat frame, mocking up different seat options with cardboard, etc. After a while, I got so frustrated with making no progress I cut off the hoop, chopped the rest of the rear seat frame off, and welded the hoop back on. this gave me a much more aggressive look, and the proportions really started to come together.<br>

    If life gives you subframe lemons, chop them right out and don't worry about 'em.<br>Along with the subframe work, I grinded off the rest of the frame tabs I wasn't going to use and bent the old rear shock mount supports around the new hoop to keep the original lines of the bike. Happy with the progress so far.
